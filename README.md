## Abstract


## Repository contents:
- [code/](https://github.com/Zquinlan/yuMultiomicAnalysis2024/tree/main/code)
  - This folder contains a single R script which was used to analyze all of the metabolomics, proteomics and genotype data.
- [data/](https://github.com/Zquinlan/yuMultiomicAnalysis2024/tree/main/code)
  - analysis/
    - Summary files including p-values and a metabolite interaction summary table
  - plots/
    - All of the extra plots which were produced on top of the circos plots
    - circos/
      - In this folder are all of the single .txt files which were used to produce the circos figure. The code for the circos plot is also in this folder as Circos requires all of the files to be in the same location
